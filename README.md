# ws-vpn
A VPN implementation over websockets. This is the client/server implementation 
of a layer-2 software switch able to route packets over websockets connections.
The ws-vpn is built on top of Linux's tun/tap device.

## Configuration

There are two config files to distinguish between client and server.

To start server execute the following command:

```
ws-vpn --config server.ini
```

client:

```
ws-vpn --config client.ini
```

### Download

You can get updated release from: https://github.com/fest-research/ws-vpn/releases

### Build and Install

Building ws-vpn needs Go 1.1 or higher.

ws-vpn is a go-gettable package:

```
go get github.com/fest-research/ws-vpn
```

### Network forwarding
On the server the IP forwarding is needed. First we need to be sure that IP forwarding is enabled.
Very often this is disabled by default. This is done by running the following command line as root:
```
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
```

So, lets look at the iptables rules required for this to work.
```
# Allow TUN interface connections to VPN server
iptables -A INPUT -i tun0 -j ACCEPT

 # Allow TUN interface connections to be forwarded through other interfaces
iptables -A FORWARD -i tun0 -j ACCEPT

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE

iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o tun0 -j ACCEPT

iptables -A FORWARD -i tun0 -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

```
